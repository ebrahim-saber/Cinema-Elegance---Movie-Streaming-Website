I've created CinemaElegance, a sophisticated movie streaming platform with a classic cinema aesthetic. The application features a dark color scheme with gold accents, creating an elegant and premium cinematic experience.

The website includes a responsive layout that works beautifully across all device sizes, with carefully designed components like the movie cards, video player, and hero sections. The interface incorporates subtle film grain textures and animations to enhance the classic cinema feel.

The application connects to a movie database API (mocked for this demonstration) to fetch movie information, posters, and trailers. Each movie has a detailed page with cast information, similar recommendations, and playback options. The video player includes custom controls styled to match the overall aesthetic of the site.

To start using the site, you can browse movies by category, use the search functionality to find specific titles, or explore featured content on the homepage.
